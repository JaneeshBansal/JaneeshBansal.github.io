## About me

I am a second-year Biological Sciences PhD student at Queen Mary University of London supervised by [Prof Richard Nichols](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/richardnichols.html), [Dr Matteo Fumagalli](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/matteo-fumagalli.html), [Dr Bob Verity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.verity) and [Prof Alexander Gnedin](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/gnedina.html). 

I graduated from Queen Mary university of London in 2022 with a MSc in Bioinformatics and I graduated from the University of Bath in 2021 in with a BSc(Hons) Natural Sciences Biochemistry Major and Chemistry Minor. 


## What do I research

- ðŸ“Œ My overall work is on using Bayesian Inference and Deep Learning approaches to infer patterns of disease spread from the genomes of the malaria parasite. 
- ðŸ”­ I am currently investigating demographic inference softwares and their frameworks. I have been explaining their outputs using simulations and ordinary differential equations to descibe the logic. These tools also produce the same results in population bottleneck and substructure scenarios and I am trying to distinguish between them using Approximate Bayesian Computation. 
- ðŸ”­ My next project will be investigating a malaria tool hmmIBD and its results.
