Work Experience 
======
* Brunel University London - Computational Biology Internship
  * JUNE 2021 – SEPTEMBER 2021
  * Learning Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) through monthly meetings and online tutorials, with the support of Dr Sarath Dantu. With the foundations, I explored PETases and CUTinases and compared the residues present which facilitate catalytic activity. Using trajectories, I could alter the protein to display areas of high movement and thus  producing high quality graphics

* University of Bath - Bioimaging Internship
  * JUNE 2020 – SEPTEMBER 2020
  * Working as an undergraduate researcher I investigated the ROCK signaling pathway. I expanded my knowledge of bioimaging software's such as Ilastik and ImageJ. I analysed cells at different stages of the cell cycle and identified the effects of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27. Using the outputs from Ilastik, I used R to present my findings to the team in weekly meetings. Eager to expand my knowledge on Bioimaging I continued this research in my final year project.
